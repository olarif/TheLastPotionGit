    dialogue: The Resistance Potion couldn't block the curse, the Restoration Potion

    dialogue: Since the body will turn into dirt, and the plants can survive in the

      Aha, here is one!      '

    dialogue: I've got Persimmon Tannin and Perlite in the storage, and I know Nick
      grew some Windtea in his front yard!
