    dialogue: 'Dear Master Rowan,

      It''s been a while. Has Master found the
      solution?'
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0a6e73cc12d7b9448b234314568fdf7a, type: 2}
    dialogue: Our priest has died from the spell, but the church seems reluctant
      to send another one to our place. Instead, they provided shelter in the nearby
      town, so all the villagers have retreated there.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0a6e73cc12d7b9448b234314568fdf7a, type: 2}
    dialogue: However, I stay because that the curse has also infected my wife, Hannah.
      As I said in the last letter, the petrified part can be easily fractured by
      simply touching it. So I can't move her around.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0a6e73cc12d7b9448b234314568fdf7a, type: 2}
    dialogue: Nevertheless, I've got a discovery. I prescribed the Growth Formula
      Zeta for Hannah. Surprisingly, Her petrified legs had been repaired, but she
      also mutated into a dryad painfully.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0a6e73cc12d7b9448b234314568fdf7a, type: 2}
    dialogue: Now I'm trying to brew the Great Growth Retardant, but the Furymint
      and Abalathian Rock Salt are hard to obtain. So I mustered up the courage to
      ask Master for supplements in these ingredients.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0a6e73cc12d7b9448b234314568fdf7a, type: 2}
    dialogue: "Sincerely,\r\nBran Crowfield\r"
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0a6e73cc12d7b9448b234314568fdf7a, type: 2}
    dialogue: '"Now the letter is written. Take it to the relay stable and I''m sure
      some travelers would help me send this."'
