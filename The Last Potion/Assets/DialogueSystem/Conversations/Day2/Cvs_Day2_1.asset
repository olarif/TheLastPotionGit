    dialogue: Last night, Hannah was in untold suffering.

    dialogue: "Spouts grew on her head.\r\nSome threads were also growing around
      the finger points and winding like roots.\r\nEven a layer of xylem grew on
      top of her skin. \r"
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 9c06056877b44b04f8b1ffa5bde45c0e, type: 2}
    dialogue: "Bran tried to pull the sprouts off or cut the roots off, but that
      hurt Hannah even more.\r\nThe stems, the roots, the leaves\u2026.. All of them
      seem to become part of her body.\r\nShe is turning into a dryad, which is highly
      unexpected.\r\n"

    dialogue: "However, even though the transformation hurts her a lot, her body
      stops decaying now.\r\nEven the decayed legs have grown back\u2026... in a
      root form.\r\nHer pulse was passing throughout her body. The vibration was
      pumping.\r\n"

    dialogue: "When the sunrise, the transformation seems to slow down.\r\nHer breath
      is not as short as it was last night.\r"
